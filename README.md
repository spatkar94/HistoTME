## HistoTME: Predicting tumor microenvironment composition and immunotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer from digital histopathology images 

# Overview 
Implementation of HistoTME in our paper "Predicting tumor microenvironment composition and immunotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer from digital histopathology images":
[Citation]

This code can be used to run attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) to predict TME signatures derived from bulk transcriptomics. In order to run experiments on the histopathology datasets, please download the features extracted by the UNI foundation model for the TCGA and CPTAC H&E whole slide images.

# Installation
Tested with Python 3.8. Tested on both GPU (should I test on CPU?).
